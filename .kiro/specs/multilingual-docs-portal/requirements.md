# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a modern, multilingual documentation portal for a decentralized digital-identity SaaS platform. The system will host API documentation and knowledge base content with enterprise-grade UX inspired by Twilio, Stripe, and Slack documentation sites. The portal will support multiple languages, API versioning, high-performance static content delivery, and advanced search capabilities while maintaining a lightweight architecture with minimal database dependencies.

## Requirements

2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text and provide context
3. WHEN a user searches THEN the system SHALL filter results by current language and API version
4. WHEN a user presses Cmd+K or Ctrl+K THEN the system SHALL open the search interface
5. WHEN the site is built THEN the system SHALL generate a static search index with less than 200KB payload

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a documentation user, I want intuitive navigation with a collapsible sidebar and table of contents, so that I can easily browse and orient myself within the documentation structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing documentation THEN the system SHALL display a left sidebar with multi-level collapsible sections
2. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support arrow key navigation in the sidebar
3. WHEN viewing a documentation page THEN the system SHALL display a right-side table of contents with scroll spy
4. WHEN a user collapses sidebar sections THEN the system SHALL persist the state in localStorage
5. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL convert the sidebar to a responsive drawer

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer reading code examples, I want syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy functionality, so that I can easily understand and use the provided code snippets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code blocks are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting using Shiki
2. WHEN a user hovers over a code block THEN the system SHALL display a copy-to-clipboard button
3. WHEN code examples have multiple formats THEN the system SHALL display them in tabbed interfaces
4. WHEN code blocks include language information THEN the system SHALL display language badges
5. WHEN a user clicks copy THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback of successful copying

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a documentation user, I want to switch between dark and light themes, so that I can read comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site THEN the system SHALL detect their system theme preference
2. WHEN a user toggles the theme THEN the system SHALL persist their preference in localStorage and cookies
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL apply smooth transitions between themes
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL prevent theme flashing by using SSR-compatible theme detection
5. WHEN themes are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast ratios

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the documentation portal to be deployed with Docker and automatic SSL, so that I can maintain a secure, production-ready environment with minimal configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use Docker Compose with multi-stage builds for optimization
2. WHEN SSL certificates are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically obtain and renew them via Let's Encrypt
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL include health checks for all services
4. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL apply security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
5. WHEN static assets are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them with appropriate caching headers

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a documentation user, I want the site to load quickly and perform well on all devices, so that I can access information efficiently regardless of my connection or device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is tested with Lighthouse THEN it SHALL achieve a score of 95+ on all metrics
2. WHEN the initial page loads THEN the JavaScript bundle SHALL be less than 300KB
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL optimize them automatically
4. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL prefetch visible links on hover
5. WHEN content is served THEN it SHALL be statically exported for maximum speed

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the documentation to be fully accessible, so that I can navigate and consume content using assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is rendered THEN it SHALL use semantic HTML5 landmarks
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via Tab, Arrow keys, and Esc
