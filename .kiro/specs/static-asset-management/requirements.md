# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive static asset management system for an MDX-driven documentation site. The system will provide secure, efficient hosting and serving of images and binary resources with content hashing, responsive image generation, and seamless MDX integration. The solution prioritizes security, performance, and developer experience while maintaining a clean separation between content and assets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content author, I want to reference images and binary assets in my MDX content using simple relative paths, so that I can focus on writing without worrying about complex asset URLs or build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a content author references an image using a relative path in MDX THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve and serve the optimized asset
2. WHEN a content author references a binary file (PDF, ZIP, etc.) THEN the system SHALL provide a downloadable link with file metadata
3. WHEN content is authored THEN asset references SHALL work consistently across different locales and versions
4. WHEN assets are referenced THEN the system SHALL validate asset existence and provide clear error messages for missing files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want assets to be automatically processed and optimized during the build process, so that the site delivers fast-loading, appropriately sized images without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL copy all referenced assets from content folders to `/public/assets/`
2. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL apply content hashing to filenames for cache busting
3. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL optionally generate responsive derivatives (@1x/@2x) and modern formats (AVIF/WEBP)
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL emit an `assets-manifest.json` mapping source paths to public URLs
5. WHEN the build runs multiple times with unchanged content THEN the system SHALL produce idempotent output without duplicate files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want assets to be organized with locale and version scoping, so that different versions and languages can have their own asset sets without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL support locale/version scoping using `/public/assets/<locale>/<version>/` structure
2. WHEN assets are scoped THEN the system SHALL maintain proper isolation between different locale/version combinations
3. WHEN assets are accessed THEN the system SHALL resolve the correct asset based on the current locale and version context
4. WHEN assets are organized THEN the system SHALL maintain a clear canonical structure under `/public/assets/`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want images to load quickly with proper responsive behavior and fallbacks, so that I have a smooth browsing experience regardless of my device or connection speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use Next.js `next/image` component for optimization
2. WHEN image dimensions are unknown THEN the system SHALL preserve aspect ratio and show a skeleton loader
3. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL serve appropriately sized variants based on device capabilities
4. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallbacks with meaningful alt text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the asset system to be secure and follow best practices, so that the site is protected from common vulnerabilities and performs optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL validate file types and reject potentially dangerous files
2. WHEN assets are served THEN the system SHALL include appropriate security headers
3. WHEN asset URLs are generated THEN the system SHALL prevent directory traversal attacks
4. WHEN assets are cached THEN the system SHALL use secure caching strategies with proper invalidation
5. WHEN the system processes assets THEN it SHALL follow security best practices for file handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content author, I want binary assets to display helpful metadata and download options, so that users can understand what they're downloading before clicking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN binary assets are referenced THEN the system SHALL display file size and type information
2. WHEN binary assets are clicked THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate download behavior
3. WHEN binary assets are processed THEN the system SHALL extract and store metadata in the manifest
4. WHEN binary assets are displayed THEN the system SHALL exclude them from search indexing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MDX processing pipeline to automatically convert standard Markdown image and link syntax to use the optimized asset components, so that existing content works seamlessly with the new system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MDX content contains standard Markdown image syntax THEN the system SHALL automatically convert it to use `<DocImage />`
2. WHEN MDX content contains links to binary files THEN the system SHALL automatically convert them to use `<DocAssetLink />`
3. WHEN content is processed THEN the conversion SHALL preserve all original attributes and metadata
4. WHEN automatic conversion occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing content

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want comprehensive examples and documentation for the asset system, so that content authors can quickly understand how to use the new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL include working examples of image usage
2. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL include working examples of binary asset usage
3. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate both manual component usage and automatic conversion
4. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include best practices for asset organization and optimization
