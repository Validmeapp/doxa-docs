# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The multilingual documentation portal needs to complete several core content processing features to provide a robust and user-friendly documentation experience. The system currently has partial implementations for content loading, navigation building, and code block rendering, but needs completion of home document enforcement, filesystem-based sidebar generation, relaxed code fence requirements, and comprehensive link integrity auditing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a documentation user, I want to access a canonical home page for each locale/version combination, so that I have a clear starting point for exploring the documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/{locale}/{version}/` (with or without trailing slash) THEN the system SHALL render the content from `/{locale}/{version}/index.mdx`
2. WHEN the system processes content THEN it SHALL treat `/{locale}/{version}/index.mdx` as the canonical home/start page for that locale/version combination
3. WHEN `index.mdx` exists in a locale/version directory THEN the system SHALL load and display its content as the home page
4. IF `index.mdx` is missing from a locale/version directory THEN the system SHALL show a friendly "Missing home document" page with guidance rather than a 404 error
5. WHEN the missing home document page is displayed THEN it SHALL provide clear instructions on how to create the missing `index.mdx` file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content author, I want the sidebar navigation to be automatically generated from the filesystem structure, so that I don't need to manually maintain navigation configuration for every content change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system builds navigation THEN it SHALL generate the sidebar from actual directories and files under the current `/{locale}/{version}/` tree
2. WHEN no sidebar configuration exists THEN the system SHALL derive groups from directories and order files alphabetically unless frontmatter `sidebar_position` is present
3. WHEN frontmatter contains `sidebar_position` THEN the system SHALL use that value for ordering instead of alphabetical sorting
4. WHEN directories exist in the content structure THEN the system SHALL create collapsible navigation groups with human-friendly labels derived from directory names
5. WHEN the system encounters a `_sidebar.json` or `_sidebar.mjs` file in `/{locale}/{version}/` THEN it SHALL use that configuration to specify custom order, hide items, and provide custom titles
6. WHEN sidebar configuration exists THEN it SHALL allow defining human-friendly group labels for directories while maintaining filesystem-based structure
7. WHEN the system processes navigation THEN it SHALL use a single-pass filesystem walker to avoid performance issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content author, I want to write code blocks without being forced to specify a language, so that I can include plain text examples and pseudocode without syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code fence specifies a language (e.g., ```ts) THEN the system SHALL use syntax highlighting as currently implemented
2. WHEN a code fence provides no language (e.g., ```) THEN the system SHALL render it as a code block with neutral, accessible default styling
3. WHEN untyped code blocks are rendered THEN the system SHALL turn off syntax tokenization or use reliable auto-detection if available
4. WHEN any code block is rendered THEN the copy button, line wrap, and horizontal scroll SHALL work consistently for both typed and untyped blocks
5. WHEN code blocks are processed THEN the system SHALL not fail or throw errors for missing language specifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content maintainer, I want all internal links to be validated and automatically fixed where possible, so that users don't encounter broken links in the documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system builds content THEN it SHALL traverse all MD/MDX files in `/{locale}/{version}/` and validate every markdown link
2. WHEN a markdown link references a file that does not exist THEN the system SHALL attempt to find a plausible existing target with the same slug but different extension
3. WHEN a plausible target is found THEN the system SHALL rewrite the link to point to the valid target
4. WHEN no plausible target exists THEN the system SHALL strip the link markup and leave only the text content
5. WHEN processing links THEN the system SHALL normalize relative links to be locale/version-aware and follow the current structure
6. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL fail on newly introduced broken links to prevent deployment of broken documentation
7. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL provide a command to run the link auditor independently for content validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the content processing system to be performant and reliable, so that documentation builds complete quickly and don't fail unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes content THEN it SHALL complete filesystem scanning in a single pass to minimize I/O operations
2. WHEN content validation runs THEN it SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages for any issues found
3. WHEN the system encounters malformed frontmatter THEN it SHALL log specific validation errors without crashing the build
4. WHEN processing large documentation trees THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable performance (under 30 seconds for 1000+ files)
5. WHEN errors occur during content processing THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and continue processing other files

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content author, I want consistent and reliable code block rendering across all content types, so that technical examples are always properly displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code blocks are rendered in MDX files THEN they SHALL display consistently with the same styling and functionality as markdown code blocks
2. WHEN the system processes code blocks THEN it SHALL handle edge cases like empty blocks, special characters, and very long lines gracefully
3. WHEN code highlighting fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to plain text rendering without breaking the page
4. WHEN users interact with code blocks THEN copy functionality SHALL work reliably across different browsers and devices
5. WHEN code blocks contain no content THEN the system SHALL display a clear "empty code block" message instead of rendering nothing
