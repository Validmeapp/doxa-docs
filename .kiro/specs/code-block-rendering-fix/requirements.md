# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The multilingual documentation portal currently has code blocks that are not rendering properly in the browser. Users can see the content structure (Request Body, Request Example, Response Example) but the actual code blocks are not displaying. This issue affects the user experience and makes the API documentation difficult to use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer reading the API documentation, I want to see properly formatted and syntax-highlighted code blocks, so that I can understand the API examples and implement them correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a documentation page with code blocks THEN the code blocks SHALL be visible and properly formatted
2. WHEN a user views code blocks THEN they SHALL have appropriate syntax highlighting for the specified language
3. WHEN a user hovers over a code block THEN they SHALL see a copy button to copy the code to clipboard
4. WHEN a user clicks the copy button THEN the code SHALL be copied to their clipboard successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code blocks to work consistently across different languages and content types, so that the documentation experience is uniform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code blocks are written in MDX files THEN they SHALL render consistently across all supported languages (JSON, JavaScript, Python, Bash, etc.)
2. WHEN viewing documentation in different locales THEN code blocks SHALL render identically
3. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN code blocks SHALL maintain proper contrast and readability
4. WHEN code blocks contain special characters or long lines THEN they SHALL handle overflow properly with horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content author, I want to write code blocks using standard markdown syntax, so that I can create documentation without complex markup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write code blocks using triple backticks with language specification THEN they SHALL render with proper syntax highlighting
2. WHEN I include code blocks in MDX files THEN they SHALL be processed correctly without breaking the page
3. WHEN I specify additional attributes like filename or highlighted lines THEN they SHALL be displayed appropriately
4. WHEN I save changes to MDX files THEN the code blocks SHALL update in the browser without requiring a full rebuild

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the code highlighting system to be performant and reliable, so that the documentation site loads quickly and doesn't break.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation site builds THEN code highlighting SHALL not cause build failures or timeouts
2. WHEN users load pages with multiple code blocks THEN the page SHALL load within acceptable performance thresholds
3. WHEN the highlighting system encounters unsupported languages THEN it SHALL gracefully fallback to plain text formatting
4. WHEN there are syntax errors in code examples THEN the highlighting system SHALL not crash or prevent page rendering
