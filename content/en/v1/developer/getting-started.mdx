## Initial Setup

To begin developing with ValidMe, follow these steps:

### 1. Request BackOffice Access

- Request access to the [ValidMe BackOffice](https://adminpanel.validme.tech)
- Once approved, you'll be able to sign in to the admin panel

### 2. Configure Settings

- Navigate to **Settings** in the BackOffice
- Locate the **RSA Key Management** section

### 3. Generate RSA Key Pair

In the **RSA Key Management** section:
- Generate a new RSA key pair
- These keys will be used to decrypt files that users authorize for sharing
- Store your keys securely as they cannot be recovered if lost

### 4. Create API Keys

- Go to the **API Keys** section in Settings
- Create a new token to access the ValidMe APIs
- This token will be required for all API requests

You're now ready to start integrating with ValidMe's APIs!
