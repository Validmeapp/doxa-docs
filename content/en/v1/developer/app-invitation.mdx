- A user doesn't have a ValidMe account yet
- You want to invite a user to join ValidMe

## Request Body

{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

## Response

{
  "data": {
    "message": "Invitation sent successfully"
  },
  "success": true
}
```

## Parameters

- **email** (required): The email address of the user to invite

## What Happens Next

1. An invitation email is sent to the user
2. The email contains a link to download the ValidMe app
3. The user registers in the app
4. Once registered, the user can accept requests from your organization
