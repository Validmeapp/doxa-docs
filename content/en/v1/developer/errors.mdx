# Error Handling

This guide explains the different error codes you may encounter when using the ValidMe API and how to handle them.

## Error Response Structure

All error responses follow this format:

{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable error message",
    "type": "ErrorType",
    "detail": "Detailed error description",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",
  "path": "/requests",

  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

## Common Errors

### ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND

The user account was not found in ValidMe.

**Solution:** Use the [App Invitation](/en/docs/v1/developer/app-invitation) endpoint to send an invitation to the user.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Account not found",
    "type": "AccountNotFoundError",
    "detail": "The account was not found",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",
  "path": "/requests",
  "method": "POST",
  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

### ORGANIZATION_NOT_FOUND

Your organization was not found in the system.

**Solution:** Check that your API token is correct and your organization is active in the BackOffice.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ORGANIZATION_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Organization not found",
    "type": "OrganizationNotFoundError",
    "detail": "The organization was not found",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",

  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

### ORGANIZATION_PUBLIC_KEY_NOT_FOUND

Your organization's RSA public key is not configured.

**Solution:** Generate RSA keys in BackOffice **Settings > RSA Key Management**.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ORGANIZATION_PUBLIC_KEY_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Organization public key not found",
    "type": "OrganizationPublicKeyNotFoundError",
    "detail": "The organization public key was not found",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",
  "path": "/requests",
  "method": "POST",
  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

### FLOW_NOT_FOUND

The specified Flow ID does not exist or is invalid.

**Solution:** 
- Verify the Flow ID is correct
- Check that the flow exists in **Validation Flows**
- Ensure you're using the exact Flow ID

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FLOW_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Flow not found",
    "type": "FlowNotFoundError",
    "detail": "The flow was not found",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",
  "path": "/requests",
  "method": "POST",
  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

### REQUIRED_DOCUMENT_COUNTRY_NOT_ALLOWED

The document country specified in the flow is not allowed.

**Solution:** 
- Check the flow configuration in the BackOffice
- Ensure the country is supported by ValidMe
- Verify document types and countries in the flow match your needs

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "REQUIRED_DOCUMENT_COUNTRY_NOT_ALLOWED",
    "message": "Required document country not allowed",
    "type": "RequiredDocumentCountryNotAllowed",
    "detail": "Required document country not allowed",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",
  "path": "/requests",
  "method": "POST",
  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

---

### REQUIRED_DOCUMENTS_NOT_FOUND

The user does not have the required documents to fulfill the request.

**Solution:** 
- The user must have the required documents available to submit
- Ensure the user understands what documents are needed
- Check the flow configuration to see what documents are required
- Ask the user to provide the necessary documents (e.g., National ID, passport, etc.)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "REQUIRED_DOCUMENTS_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Required documents not found",
    "type": "RequiredDocumentsNotFound",
    "detail": "Required documents not found",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",
  "path": "/requests",
  "method": "POST",
  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

---

### EMAIL_ALREADY_EXIST

The email address is already registered in the system.

**Solution:** 
- Use a different email address

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "EMAIL_ALREADY_EXIST",
    "message": "Email already exist",
    "type": "EmailAlreadyExistError",
    "detail": "The email already exist",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T20:35:53.387Z",
  "path": "/requests",
  "method": "POST",
  "requestId": "RIDqbfemk7x0j9hzqalu4mkyvky"
}
```

## Error Response Fields

- **success**: Always `false` for errors
- **error.code**: Machine-readable error code for programmatic handling
- **error.message**: Human-readable error message
- **error.type**: Error class type
- **error.detail**: Detailed description of the error
- **error.params**: Additional parameters related to the error
- **timestamp**: When the error occurred (ISO 8601 format)
- **path**: API endpoint that caused the error
- **method**: HTTP method used (POST, GET, etc.)
- **requestId**: Unique identifier for tracking this request in logs

## Best Practices

1. **Always check the error code** to determine the appropriate action
2. **Log the requestId** for debugging and support tickets
3. **Handle ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND** by sending an app invitation
4. **Validate input** before making requests to catch errors early
5. **Retry on transient errors** with exponential backoff
6. **Contact support** if errors persist with the requestId
