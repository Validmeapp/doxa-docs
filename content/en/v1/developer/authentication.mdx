# Authentication

All requests to the ValidMe API require authentication using an authorization token.

## Using Your API Token

To authenticate your requests, use the token provided from the backOffice or by the ValidMe team.

### Authorization Header

Include the authorization token in the request header:

```curl
x-vm-authorization = Bearer <<Token>>
```

### Example Usage

Replace `<<Token>>` with your actual API token provided by ValidMe:

```curl
x-vm-authorization = Bearer your_actual_token_here_abc123def456
```

## Token Management

- Obtain your token from **Settings > API Keys** in the BackOffice
- Keep your token secure and never share it publicly
- The token will not be shown again, store it securely
- If your token is compromised, contact the ValidMe team for assistance

## Authentication Errors

If you receive authentication errors:

1. Verify the token is valid and has not expired
2. Ensure the token is correctly formatted in the header
3. Check that the `x-vm-authorization` header is included in all requests
4. Generate a new token if needed from the BackOffice
