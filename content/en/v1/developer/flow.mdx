# Creating a Verification Flow

A Verification Flow defines which documents users must submit during their validation process (for example, onboarding new users).

## What is a Flow?

Flows allow you to:

- Define which documents to request from your users
- Adapt requirements based on country
- Reuse the same configuration across multiple verifications

## How to Create a Flow

1. **Sign in to your BackOffice account**

2. **Navigate to Validation Flows and select Create Flow**

3. **Complete the flow information:**
   - **Name**: A descriptive name to identify the flow (e.g., Onboarding)
   - **Description** (optional): Briefly explain the purpose of the flow

4. **In the Required Documents section:**
   - Click **Add**
   - Select the type of document required
   - Select the corresponding country
   - You can add multiple documents if necessary

5. **Click Create Flow** to save the flow, after you will see the Flow ID, you'll need it to reference this flow in API requests.

## Using a Flow in a Verification

The same flow can be reused across different types of requests by referencing its Flow ID:

- **Document Validation** → the user uploads the documents
- **Session or Consent** → the system verifies that documents are already validated

## Example

An Onboarding flow might require:

- **Document Type**: National ID
- **Country**: Bolivia

Once your flows are created, you can reference them when making API requests to validate user documents.
