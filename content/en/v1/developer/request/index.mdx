# Getting Started with Requests

## Important: Request Initiation

All requests must be initiated by the organization (company) with a **clear and simple description** so users can understand the purpose of the request and decide whether to accept or reject it.

The ValidMe API supports three main types of requests.

## Request Types

1. **[Consent Request](consent)** - Send a consent request that users can accept or reject

2. **[Document Validation Request](document-validation)** - Request users to accept and submit documents for validation

3. **[Session Request](session)** - Create a session for user login and generate authentication tokens

## Common Headers

All requests must include the authentication header:

```curl
x-vm-authorization: Bearer <<Token>>
```

## Enums

### Request Status

Represents the current state of a request throughout its lifecycle:

```ts
export enum RequestStatus {
  PENDING = 'PENDING',           // Request has been created and is waiting for user action
  CONFIRMED = 'CONFIRMED',       // User has accepted the request
  SENDING = 'SENDING',           // Request is being processed and sent to the user
  REJECTED = 'REJECTED',         // User has declined the request
  EXPIRED = 'EXPIRED',           // Request validity period has ended
  SUCCESS = 'SUCCESS',           // Request completed successfully
  FAILED = 'FAILED',             // Request processing failed
  INVALIDATED = 'INVALIDATED',   // User entered an invalid OTP code
}
```

**Status Flow:**
- Starts as `PENDING` when created
- Moves to `SENDING` as it's being processed
- Can be `CONFIRMED` (accepted) or `REJECTED` (declined) by user
- Ends as `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`
- Can become `EXPIRED` if not completed in time
- Can be `INVALIDATED` if wrong OTP is provided

### Request Category

Defines the type of request being made:

```ts
export enum RequestCategory {
  SESSION = 'SESSION',                         // User login request - generates tokens
  DOCUMENT_VALIDATION = 'DOCUMENT_VALIDATION', // User submits documents for validation
  CONSENT = 'CONSENT',                         // User accepts consent for data access
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- **SESSION**: When user needs to authenticate and get session tokens
- **DOCUMENT_VALIDATION**: When organization needs user documents
- **CONSENT**: When organization needs user to accept terms or data sharing

---

### Request Mode

Specifies what type of data is being requested:

```ts
export enum RequestMode {
  PAYLOAD = 'PAYLOAD',   // Document information in text format
  FILES = 'FILES',       // Only file uploads are requested (documents)
  ALL = 'ALL',           // Both document information data and files are requested
}
```

---

### Acceptance Mode

Determines how the user confirms acceptance of the request:

```ts
export enum AcceptanceMode {
  OTP = 'OTP',           // User enters a One-Time Password generated when request is created
  CHOICE = 'CHOICE',     // User selects the correct code from 3 options generated when request is created
  BUTTON = 'BUTTON',     // User accepts with a single button click
}
```

---

### Request Event Type (Webhooks)

Events triggered during request lifecycle. These are sent to your `callbackUrl`:

```ts
export enum RequestEventType {
    REQUEST_STATUS_PENDING = 'request.status.pending',           // Request created
    REQUEST_STATUS_CONFIRMED = 'request.status.confirmed',       // User accepted
    REQUEST_STATUS_SENDING = 'request.status.sending',           // Being processed
    REQUEST_STATUS_REJECTED = 'request.status.rejected',         // User declined
    REQUEST_STATUS_EXPIRED = 'request.status.expired',           // Time limit reached
    REQUEST_STATUS_SUCCESS = 'request.status.success',           // Completed successfully
    REQUEST_STATUS_FAILED = 'request.status.failed',             // Processing error
    REQUEST_STATUS_INVALIDATED = 'request.status.invalidated',   // Wrong OTP code
    REQUEST_DOCUMENT_SUBMITTED = 'request.document.submitted',   // Document uploaded
}
```

**Webhook Integration:**
Subscribe to these events to track request progress in real-time. ValidMe will POST to your `callbackUrl` when these events occur.
