## Step 5: Generate RSA Keys

RSA keys are fundamental to your data security.

### Why Are They Needed?

Files and sensitive data you receive through webhooks will be **encrypted** with your public key. Only you (with your private key) can decrypt them.

### Generate the Keys

1. Go to **Settings** → **RSA Key Management**
2. Click **Generate New Key Pair**
3. They will be automatically created:
   - 🔒 **Private Key** (keep it secret)
   - 🔑 **Public Key** (stored on our servers)

### 📥 Download Private Key

```
File content (example):
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCA...
...more lines...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### ⚠️ Important: Security

**NEVER share your private key:**
- ❌ Don't share it by email
- ❌ Don't upload to public repositories
- ❌ Don't save it in plain text

**DO:**
- ✅ Store it in a secure location
- ✅ Use environment variables in production
- ✅ Rotate keys every 6 months

### Store Private Key Safely

**In Production:**
```bash
# Store in environment variables
export VALIDME_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"

# Or in a .env file (NO COMMITS)
VALIDME_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
```

**In Local Development:**
```
project/
├── .env.local (git-ignore)
├── keys/
│   └── private-key.pem (git-ignore)
```

---

## Step 6: Create Your API Token

The API Token is your credential for making API requests.

### Access API Keys

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Create New Token**

### Create Token

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | "Production" or "Development" |
| **Description** | "Integration with mobile platform" |
| **Permissions** | Select required permissions |
| **Expiration** | 90 days / 1 year / No expiration |

### Token Types

**Development:**
- ✓ Use in local testing
- ✓ Short expiration (30 days)
- ✓ Limited permissions

**Production:**
- ✓ Use on live servers
- ✓ Long expiration or no expiration
- ✓ All permissions

### 📋 Copy Token

Once created, **copy it immediately** because it won't be shown again.

```
Token: sk_live_7a9k5L2m3nP4qRsTuVwXyZ1a
```

### Store Token

```bash
# Environment variable
export VALIDME_API_KEY="sk_live_7a9k5L2m3nP4qRsTuVwXyZ1a"

# In .env file (git-ignore)
VALIDME_API_KEY=sk_live_7a9k5L2m3nP4qRsTuVwXyZ1a
```

## Step 7: Configure Webhook URL

To receive real-time events, set up your webhook.

### Access Webhooks

1. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Webhook**

### Configure Endpoint

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **URL** | `https://yourapi.com/webhooks/validme` |
| **Events** | Select which events to receive |
| **Active** | Checkbox to enable |

### Available Events

- ✓ `request.status.pending` - Request created
- ✓ `request.status.confirmed` - User confirmed
- ✓ `request.status.sending` - User uploading data
- ✓ `request.document.submitted` - Document received
- ✓ `request.status.success` - Validation completed
- ✓ `request.status.rejected` - User rejected
- ✓ `request.status.failed` - Validation failed

### Test Webhook

1. Click **Test**
2. A test event will be sent to your URL
3. You should receive an HTTP POST

```
POST /webhooks/validme HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "eventType": "test.event",
  "eventPayload": { ... }
}
```
