# Authentication

Our API supports multiple authentication methods to secure your applications and protect user data.

## API Keys

The primary authentication method uses API keys that you can generate in your developer dashboard.

### Obtaining API Keys

1. Log in to your developer dashboard
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Copy and securely store your key

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

## OAuth 2.0

For applications that need to act on behalf of users, we support OAuth 2.0 with PKCE.

### Authorization Flow

1. **Authorization Request**: Redirect users to our authorization server
2. **User Consent**: Users grant permission to your application
3. **Authorization Code**: Receive an authorization code
4. **Token Exchange**: Exchange the code for access tokens

### Example Implementation

```javascript
// Step 1: Redirect to authorization server
const authUrl = `https://auth.example.com/oauth/authorize?` +
  `client_id=${clientId}&` +
  `redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&` +
  `response_type=code&` +
  `scope=read:users write:users&` +
  `code_challenge=${codeChallenge}&` +
  `code_challenge_method=S256`;

window.location.href = authUrl;
```

## JWT Tokens

For server-to-server communication, we support JWT tokens with RS256 signing.

### Token Structure

```json
{
  "header": {
    "alg": "RS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  },
  "payload": {
    "iss": "https://api.example.com",
    "sub": "user_id",
    "aud": "your_client_id",
    "exp": 1234567890,
    "iat": 1234567890,
    "scope": "read:users"
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never expose API keys** in client-side code
- Use HTTPS** for all API requests
- Rotate keys regularly** for enhanced security
- Implement proper error handling** to avoid information leakage
- Use least privilege principle** when requesting scopes
